	Linking GNU Smalltalk statically or dynamically with other modules is
	making a combined work based on GNU Smalltalk.  Thus, the terms and
	conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole

	In addition, as a special exception, the Free Software Foundation

	You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the
	GNU GPL for GNU Smalltalk and the licenses of the other code
	concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other
	code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

	Note that people who make modified versions of GNU Smalltalk are not
	obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
	versions; it is their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General
	Public License gives permission to release a modified version without
	this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a
	modified version which carries forward this exception.
